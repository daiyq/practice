do not support unicode or back reference.
support alternation, concatenation('|'), the repetition operators('*').
Explicit parentheses can be used to force different meanings.
and abbreviated writing has 3 types:
1.Character set descriptor
	1.1	Wildcard.	eg:	A.B
	1.2	specified collection[]	eg:	[ASD]	which means character is A	or S or D
	1.3	range collection[-]		eg:	[A-D][0-9]	similar
	1.4	complement[^]		eg:[^USDF]	which is not U, not S, not D, not F
2.closure for short
	2.1	+:at least once		eg:(AB)+   which can be writen like (AB)(AB)*
	2.2	?:zero or once		eg:(AB)?   which can be writen like AB | empty string
	2.3	{number}:specified times			eg:(AB){3}		which is equal to ABABAB
	2.4	{number-number}:range of times		eg:(AB){1-2}	which can be writen like AB | ABAB
3.Transfer sequence
	the metacharacters .*+?()| are used to build regex.
	To match a metacharacter itself, escape it with a backslash: \ plus character.
	eg: '\.' means '.' itself.
